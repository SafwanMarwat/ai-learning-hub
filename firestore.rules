     ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING: 
     These rules are set to public (allow read, write: if true) because the app currently 
     uses a "Local Auth" method (hardcoded admin credentials) rather than Firebase Auth.
     
     This means Firebase sees all users as "unauthenticated", so we must allow unauthenticated 
     writes for the Admin Panel to work.
     
     For a production application with sensitive data, you should switch back to 
     Firebase Authentication to properly secure your database.
